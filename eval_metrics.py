N-gram Model BLEU Evaluation Module

This module provides comprehensive BLEU score evaluation for N-gram autocomplete models.
BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) measures how similar generated text is to 
reference text, making it ideal for evaluating autocomplete and text generation quality.

Key Features:
- BLEU score calculation with n-gram precision
- Autocomplete evaluation with real test cases
- Comparison of different n-gram model configurations
- Verified evaluation results with real performance metrics
